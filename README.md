**About GitSight**

GitSight is designed to be your one-stop shop for exploring your GitHub world. With its intuitive search functionality and seamless data fetching, you can delve into repositories, users, and gists with ease.

**Features**

  * **Intuitive Search:** Effortlessly search for repositories, users, and gists using relevant keywords.
  * **Seamless Data Fetching:** Leverages the public GitHub API ([https://api.github.com/](https://api.github.com/)) to retrieve accurate and up-to-date data.
  * **Clear UI Display:** Presents search results in a well-organized list format, showcasing essential details:
      * **Repositories:** Name, description, stars, and forks.
      * **Users:** Profile information with public repository listings.
      * **Gists:** Content and other relevant data.
  * **Effortless Dark Mode:** Toggle between a light and dark theme to optimize user experience in diverse lighting conditions.
  * **Eye-catching Animations:** Smooth transitions and interactions powered by Flutter's animation capabilities enhance the user experience.
  * **Informative Loading Indicators:** Provide visual feedback during data fetching, keeping users informed.
  * **Robust API Rate Limiting:** Implements a mechanism to manage API requests and avoid exceeding GitHub's rate limits.
  * **Error Handling with Grace:** Handles API errors and network issues gracefully, displaying informative messages and options for retrying or reporting problems.
  * **Credit Where Credit's Due:** Acknowledges the creators of the app, DaDevMikey and DevMikey123, with a link to the official GitHub repository: DaDevMikey/Github-Insights.
  * **Personalized Homepage (Planned):**
      * **Bookmarking:** Save your favorite repositories, users, and gists for quick and easy access later.
      * **Customization Options:** (Future Implementation) Enable user preferences for font size, theme colors, and list view style to enhance individual user experience.
  * **Informative Info Menu:** Provides an "Info" menu with details about the app, including:
      * **Creators' GitHub Profile:** @DaDevMikey
      * **Official GitSight Website:** [https://GitSights.vercel.app/](https://GitSights.vercel.app/)
